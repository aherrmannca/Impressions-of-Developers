    "# Impressions on Video Game Developers from Online Forums\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reasoning:\n",
    "Knowledge of webscraping gives access to the largest bank of data available. Almost any website can become a source of data. Its use can range from analyzing competitors to learning more about a user base.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would make sense to scrape through comments of each post too, but that would take far too long. GameFaqs is at least very casual so posts there will be as opinionated as comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "The slightly long-winded title explains most of what this notebook is about. My goal is to scrape the post titles from Reddit and Gamefaqs to perform sentiment analysis on them on top of a some data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods:\n",
    "I will be using selenium to scroll through all reddit posts and to do some other automation used for clicking buttons. BeautifulSoup will be used to scrape and retrieve the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will need to scrape a list of current common user agents and lists of free, recent proxies to rotate through for GameFaqs. They use pages and not infinite scrolling so too many http requests will result in a ban. To play it safe and uninterrupted a few measures will be taken. These IPs and user agents could be used for scraping any other website as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be obtaining all posts from the past year and filter out the ones which don't mention any that don't mention a developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Featured:\n",
    "- Webscraping with BeautifulSoup and Selenium\n",
    "- Advanced knowledge on how to rotate proxies and user agents\n",
    "- Working with Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "- Data analysis and visualization\n"
